## üß† Concept Inspiration

While researching **3R planar leg mechanisms**, I came across the design of **Redundant Articulated Legs** used in advanced quadruped robots. A standout example is the **HADE (Hybrid Actuator Development) Leg**, which simulates the biomechanics of a horse's leg.

<img src="images/HADE.jpeg" alt="HADE Hybrid Actuator Development" width="500"/>

The HADE-inspired structure consists of:

* **Three segments**: Thigh, Shank, and Foot
* **Three joints**: Hip, Knee, and Ankle

This configuration forms a **3R planar chain** capable of high degrees of motion and control within a vertical plane (XZ). It's particularly effective for achieving a **high payload-to-weight ratio**, which is critical in agile quadrupeds.

## üõ†Ô∏è Structural Design ‚Äî 3R Planar Leg

Inspired by the **HADE leg mechanism**, I designed a **3R planar robotic leg** using Fusion 360. The structure mimics a horse-like leg consisting of:

* **Thigh**
* **Shank**
* **Foot**

Each segment is connected through:

* **Hip Joint (R1)**
* **Knee Joint (R2)**
* **Ankle Joint (R3)**

The leg is modeled to move in a **2D vertical plane (XZ)**, forming a **3R serial chain** ‚Äî ideal for simulating walking or climbing motions in quadruped robots like Spot or HADE.

**Kinematics of a 3R Planar Robotic Leg**



## 1. System Overview

The robotic leg modeled in Fusion 360 consists of three rigid links and three revolute joints (3R), forming a planar manipulator that operates in the XZ plane. It resembles the leg structure of quadrupedal robots like Boston Dynamics' Spot or the SEA-driven HADE leg.

### Link Lengths (as per Fusion 360 model):

* Thigh (L1): 453.018 mm
* Shin  (L2): 453.056 mm
* Foot  (L3): 188.056 mm

All joints rotate in the plane, and we assume counterclockwise rotation is positive.

---

## 2. Forward Kinematics

### üéØ Goal:

To find the foot position `(x, z)` based on the current angles of the hip, knee, and ankle motors.

### üì• Inputs:

* `theta1`: Hip joint angle (in degrees or radians)
* `theta2`: Knee joint angle (relative to thigh)
* `theta3`: Ankle joint angle (relative to shin)

### üß† Logic:

The robot leg has 3 links connected in series.

1. First link (thigh) rotates by `theta1`
2. Second link (shin) rotates by `theta2` **relative to the thigh**
3. Third link (foot) rotates by `theta3` **relative to the shin**

### ü™ú Steps:

1. Add up the angles cumulatively:

   * `a1 = theta1`
   * `a2 = theta1 + theta2`
   * `a3 = theta1 + theta2 + theta3`

2. For each link, calculate its `(x, z)` contribution:

   * Link 1: `(x1, z1)` = `(L1 * cos(a1), L1 * sin(a1))`
   * Link 2: `(x2, z2)` = `(L2 * cos(a2), L2 * sin(a2))`
   * Link 3: `(x3, z3)` = `(L3 * cos(a3), L3 * sin(a3))`

3. Total foot position:

   * `x = x1 + x2 + x3`
   * `z = z1 + z2 + z3`

### üì§ Output:

* `x`: Horizontal position of the foot
* `z`: Vertical position of the foot

You can implement this easily in Arduino using `cos()` and `sin()` functions after converting degrees to radians.

---

## 3. Inverse Kinematics

### üéØ Goal:

To find the angles `theta1`, `theta2`, and `theta3` needed to move the foot to a given position `(x, z)` with a desired orientation `phi`.

### üì• Inputs:

* `x, z`: Target position of the foot
* `phi`: Desired angle of the foot (i.e., end angle of total leg)

### ü™ú Steps:

1. Subtract the foot link‚Äôs contribution:

   * `x' = x - L3 * cos(phi)`
   * `z' = z - L3 * sin(phi)`

2. Now solve the triangle between hip, knee, and ankle base (L1, L2):

   * Find distance `r` = sqrt(`x'^2 + z'^2`)
   * Use Law of Cosines to find `theta2`

     * `cos(theta2) = (r¬≤ - L1¬≤ - L2¬≤) / (2 * L1 * L2)`
     * `theta2 = acos(...)`

3. Find `theta1` using two vectors:

   * First vector: angle to `(x', z')` using `atan2(z', x')`
   * Second vector: triangle internal angle using `atan2(...)`
   * `theta1 = atan2(z', x') - atan2(...)`

4. Compute `theta3`:

   * `theta3 = phi - (theta1 + theta2)`

### üì§ Output:

* `theta1`, `theta2`, `theta3`: Angles to set each joint to reach foot target

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:

* IK may return 2 solutions: elbow-up and elbow-down
* Use bounds or physical constraints to choose the valid one
* Make sure `acos()` input is in range \[-1, 1] to avoid math error

This method is clean and can be implemented directly in Arduino using trigonometric functions.

---

## 4. Use in Arduino

* Use `sin()` and `cos()` functions for FK
* Use `sqrt()`, `atan2()`, and `acos()` for IK
* Convert degrees ‚Üî radians as needed: `radians = degrees * PI / 180`
* PID or servo commands can use these angles directly
